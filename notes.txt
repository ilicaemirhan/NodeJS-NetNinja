In nodeJS we create servers. Unlike php and jsp where apache handles it.

Port numbers like doors into a computer which internet communication made for different programs.

You can't do file operations with plain javascript but node makes it possible.

Some Status Codes I should know about:
        200 - OK
        301 - Resource Moved
        404 - Not Found
        500 - Internal Server Error

npm install <-- Use this to download added dependencies.

EJS TAGS:
        <% 'Scriptlet' tag, for control-flow, no output
        <%_ 'Whitespace Slurping' Scriptlet tag, strips all whitespace before it
        <%= Outputs the value into the template (escaped)
        <%- Outputs the unescaped value into the template
        <%# Comment tag, no execution, no output
        <%% Outputs a literal '<%'
        %%> Outputs a literal '%>'
        %> Plain ending tag

Middlewares works between server and requests. You can use them to increase security, as a logger etc.

To keep app.js clean we can create route files like blogRoutes.js

MVC(Model View Controller) is a way to structure our code & files.
